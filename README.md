## Running website locally

See the [Github pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) to install the required tools, including Jekyll.

After installation, the quick shell commands I run on my mac are:
- `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"`
- `bundle install`
- `bundle exec jekyll serve`

The last command serves the website at `http://localhost:4000`.
